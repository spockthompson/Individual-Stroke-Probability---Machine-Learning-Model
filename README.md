# Individual Stroke Probability - Machine Learning Model
## This data set uses key features to predict the probability that an individual with specific characteristics is at risk of stroke.

**Scotty Thomason**: 

### Predictions of an individuals probability/or risk of stroke :

In a situation were we can potentially determine if a patient is at risk of stroke simply by recording a few characteristics of their overall general health and specific habits. Medical institutions could pro-actively help prevent strokes by providing medications or daily routines and better understand why they occur in different instances.


### Data:
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)


## Methods
- Cleaning of the original data
- Appying different models on training data
- Evaluating scores
- Final model creation and score

## Results (Model)

Final model was a K-nearest neighbors algorithm with PCA


Even thought our data set did not have a very high-demention, the KNN with PCA gave the best score overall at 94%
I would say this is the best model so far, I know there is a better one to do these predictions and this may be updated in the furture. As for now the Final model of KNN with PCA will do.



## Recommendations:

More trials with other models and possibly more data and categories to make a richer data set.
Always can improve models.
